        <p class="information">Hi! I'm a 16-year-old Vietnamese-American high school senior from Southern California. I am a volunteer, peer tutor, gamer, tennis player, graphic designer, and programmer/coder. At school, I am president of the future health professionals club, peer tutoring club, and vietnamese student association.</p>
          <p class="instructions">Inspiration</p>
          <p class="information">I learned web development (3 coding languages: html, css, and javascript) through Girls Who Code's SIP, and wanted to use my skills to make an impact. I started on this project around the time Roe v. Wade was overturned. So, I guess that event was the exigence. However, as a girl online, I personally have dealt with a lot of sexist micro-aggressions and interactions with misogynist users, especially when I am gaming. So, women's rights, gender equality, and the feminist movement has been something that I have highly resonated with. I created this website to help people better understand what feminism is and how to be supportive of the feminist movement. </p>
