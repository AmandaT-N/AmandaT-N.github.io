  <p class="information">  "Want to level the playing field? Break the glass ceiling? Make room for women at the table of power? Then you're espousing liberal feminism. Campaigns for legislative-based gender equity—from the ERA to Title IX to Roe v. Wade to the Violence Against Women Act to landmark sexual-harassment suits...all arise out of liberal feminism.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="flex-item">
<p class= "information">  The “liberal” part refers not to today's muddled characterizations of Democrats, progressives, or granolas in general but rather to the 300-year-old political philosophy detailing the natural rights of “man”: inalienable rights to government, property, the development of powers, and gratification of desire—in other words, life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness, and the right to vote and to shop."</p>

      <p class="margin-left-right">“By failing to create a mass-based educational movement to teach everyone about feminism, we allow mainstream patriarchal mass media to remain the primary place where folks learn about feminism, and most of what they learn is negative. Teaching feminist thought and theory ever means that we have to reach past the academic and even the written word. Masses of folks lack the skills to read most feminist books“</p>

      <p class="section-title">Internalized Sexism</p>
      <p class="script-instructions">Female solidarity is very important to feminism, and to be a feminist, we have to conquer the demon within: internalized sexism.</p>
      <p class="margin-left-right">“We knew firsthand that we had been socialized as females by patriarchal thinking to see ourselves as inferior to men, to see ourselves as always and only in competition with one another for patriarchal approval, to look upon each other with jealousy, fear, and hatred. Sexist thinking made us judge each other without compassion and punish one another harshly. Feminist thinking helped us unlearn female self-hatred. It enabled us to break free of the hold patriarchal thinking had on our consciousness.” - Bell Hooks, Feminism is for Everybody

        <p class="section-title">Abortion</p>
        <p class="margin-left-right">“The women of the late ‘60’s and early ‘70’s who clamored for abortions had seen the tragedies of illegal abortions, the misery of forced marriages as a consequence of unwanted pregnancies… talented, creative women whose lives had been changed by unplanned and unwanted pregnancies; we witnessed their bitterness, their rage, their disappointment with their lot in life. And we were clear that there could be no genuine sexual liberation for women and men without better safer contraceptives.</p>
        <br>
<p class="margin-left-right">
...Many of my peers saw abortion as a better choice than conscious, vigilant use of birth control pills. And they did frequently use abortion as a means of birth control. Using the pill meant a woman was directly confronting her choice to be sexually active. It was easier for some females just to let things happen sexually then take care of the “problem” later with abortions. We now know that both repeated abortions or prolonged use of birth control pills with high levels of estrogen are not risk-free. Yet, women were willing to take risks to have sexual freedom – to have the right to choose.”

        <p class="dialogue">"Now that we know what abortions mean to females, let’s move on to something very relevant today…
          <br>
        the Overturning of Roe v Wade"
</p>
        <p class="margin-left-right">Once feminist movement created the cultural revolution which made the use of relatively risk-free contraceptives acceptable and the right to have a safe, legal abortion possible, women simply assumed those rights would no longer be questioned. </p>
<br>
        <p class="instructions">BUT</p>
<br>
          <p class="margin-left-right">The demise of an organized, radical feminist mass-based political movement coupled with anti-feminist backlash from an organized right-wing policial front which relies on fundamentalist interpretations of religion placed abortion back on the political agenda. The right of females to choose is now called into question.
</p>
        <br>

  <p class="instructions">IF WE DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR BODIES, WE RISK RELINQUISHING RIGHTS IN ALL OTHER AREAS OF OUR LIVES.
</p>

        <p class="margin-left-right">The overturning of Roe v. Wade is a direct attack at women's rights and the feminist movement.</p>

        <p class="margin-left-right">“When women first organized in groups to talk together about the issue of sexism and male domination, they were clear that females were just as socialized to believe sexist thinking and values as males, the difference simply that males benefited from sexism more than females and were as a consequence less likely to want to surrender patriarchal privilege” (Hooks).</p>
